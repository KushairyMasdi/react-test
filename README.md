React test for Web Application Developer

This is my submission for the Web Application Developer position.

ReactJS is a new language to me, which was why it took me longer than expected for this attempt. I learned the language from zero, but with the help of my knowledge of
HTML, JS, and CSS, I took to it quickly.
